# Description
[Movies in data](https://moviesindata.substack.com/) is a coming substack examining the intersection of art and commerce through the lens of data in the film industry. There is an endless amount of commentary questioning either the [death](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottphillips/2024/06/14/is-the-death-of-movie-theaters-upon-us/) or [salvation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeschultze/2023/08/24/did-the-summer-of-barbie-save-the-movies/) of the theatrical movie going experience. These publications tend to use box office anomalies as evidence for or against the state of movie going. Although this commentary can be productive, it tends to be fairly myopic and ignore the plethora of factors influencing box office. 

This publication will use in-depth statistical analysis to help explain box office performance and the state of movie going. 

Coming posts include:
- The relationship between runtime and box office success
- What happened to the studio comedy?
- What happened to the romcom?
- Does the movie star still matter?
- And many more!

Stay tuned!
